# DeepSpace2019

Code for FRC 687's 2019 robots, [Gigantor](https://i.imgur.com/NvAybQzh.jpg) and Brontwo.

Our 2019 robot was our first robot to be powered by [NerdyLib](https://github.com/nerdherd/NerdyLib), our team's robot and year-agnostic library for FIRST Robotics Competition robots.

## Main Features:
- [Motion-profiled control](https://github.com/nerdherd/DeepSpace2019/blob/master/src/main/java/com/team687/commands/superstructure/SimultaneousMovement.java) of [Arm](https://github.com/nerdherd/DeepSpace2019/blob/master/src/main/java/com/team687/subsystems/Arm.java) and [Elevator](https://github.com/nerdherd/DeepSpace2019/blob/master/src/main/java/com/team687/subsystems/Elevator.java) Subsytems
- Multiple [autonomous modes](https://github.com/nerdherd/DeepSpace2019/tree/master/src/main/java/com/team687/commands/auto) powered by a custom proportional-derivative trajectory [follower](https://github.com/nerdherd/NerdyLib/blob/1d2b96de38052dbee386700bd30fa41df6bcf7d5/src/main/java/com/nerdherd/lib/drivetrain/auto/DriveFalconTrajectory.java) using paths generated by FRC Team 5190's [Falcon Library](https://github.com/FRC5190/FalconLibrary)
- [Semi-automated](https://github.com/nerdherd/DeepSpace2019/blob/master/src/main/java/com/team687/commands/climber/SuckAndLift.java) vaccuum/suction [climber](https://github.com/nerdherd/DeepSpace2019/blob/master/src/main/java/com/team687/subsystems/Climber.java)
- Custom vision [target tracking](https://github.com/nerdherd/DeepSpace2019/blob/master/src/main/java/com/team687/commands/vision/TargetTrack.java) using a [Jevois](https://github.com/nerdherd/DeepSpace2019/blob/master/src/main/java/com/team687/subsystems/Jevois.java) smart camera


In addition, our software team wrote a [Software Binder](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GWe93W186P_5ae7Ai7O43S8fEdd6IMaK/view?usp=sharing) documenting our software and controls processes more in-depth
